# Project 3: Build a Full-Stack MERN App as a Team

## Overview

This is your first **full-team project**. You and your group will work together to **design, architect, and build a MERN stack app** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

This project is about two things:

1. **Technical skill** â€“ putting together a real MERN app.
2. **Collaboration** â€“ learning how to plan, divide tasks, and build as a team.

ðŸ’¡ **Use the [Goat Cafe Project](https://github.com/SEB-9-BH/goat-cafe-full-stack-mern-app-lesson) as your guide!** It shows you the flow of a full MERN build step-by-step.

## Planning & Setup

### Pitch Deck

Prepare a short pitch with:

* App name
* Team members + roles
* The problem your app solves

See examples: [Meal Ticket](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CsBuC-a_AZ1yXJEE-EbptPIdgj1MktiNALyQyhaFfrM/edit#slide=id.p), [Tripio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gvOypLc4VjKqJzdAW68iwh28uGDSH4Sp1KnA5grDo2g/edit#slide=id.p), [Pantry](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WvHoN5MNaRembgcoog5p0GtivVCOZSzvfPyeevzy08g/edit), [ArtWorld](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yGy2Mh3n6IhPxFu4XKnnMtPPi4OGFPpf-Z_TMYw6wQY/edit#slide=id.g7ba109823e_2_7)
### Trello Board

Your Trello should include:

* **User Stories** (Ice Box â†’ Current/MVP â†’ Completed)
* **Wireframes** of key pages
* **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**

Template for User Stories:

> *As a \<user>, I want \<feature>, because \<reason>.*

## Technical Requirements

âœ… Must be a **MERN stack app**
âœ… Persist data with **MongoDB**
âœ… **JWT Authentication** (login/signup)
âœ… **Authorization** (only allow users to edit/delete their own content)
âœ… Deployed to [**Render**](https://expressdeployment.onrender.com/)

ðŸ”‘ Start with **models** before building extra features.

---

## Team Workflow

* Use **Git + GitHub** with feature branches and pull requests.
* Assign roles (Scrum Master, GitHub Manager, Designer, Database Manager, etc.).
* Commit early and often.
* Only one dev should work on a file at a time to avoid conflicts.

## Presentation Requirements

Each team gets \~15 minutes to present:

1. Intro project (paraphrase README)
2. Demo app (CRUD flow)
3. Show code (model, controller, routes, React components)
4. Share challenges + key learnings
5. Q\&A

Everyone on the team must present.

---

## README Requirements

Your teamâ€™s repo **must include a README** with:

* App intro + screenshot
* Technologies used
* Links to pitch deck, Trello, and deployed Heroku app
* Planned future enhancements

---

## Suggestions for Success

1. **Keep MVP small.** Donâ€™t chase every feature.
2. **Stay consistent** with code style.
3. **Pair program** or even mob program when stuck.
4. **Commit early, commit often.**
5. **Ask for help on Slack** (not DMs).

---

## Evaluation

Youâ€™ll be graded on:

* Meeting technical requirements
* Team collaboration & workflow
* Presentation quality
* Code clarity

---

## Reminder

ðŸ‘‰ **Follow the Goat Cafe project as your blueprint.** Itâ€™s your map for how a MERN app should be structured and built.
